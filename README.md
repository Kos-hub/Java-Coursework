Java coursework for uni 

I was supplied with a Java Library that contained weather data recorded at different locations in the UK during 2015.
I was also supplied with another Java Library that allowed me to plot geographic coordinates on a world map.
The challenge was reading the data, putting it into an HashMap and using it to answer the following questions: 

6) Which weather station has the most weather readings? Output the Id,
name, coordinates and the number of readings to the system console.
Plot the location using the MapGui class supplied. Include a screenshot in
your Word document along with the console output.

7) What was the highest temperature recorded at CAIRNGORM SUMMIT
(3065)?
Output the temperature, Year, Month and Date that the maximum
temperature was recorded to the console.
Plot the Weather Station on a map using the MapGui class supplied.
Include a screenshot in your Word document.

8) What were the minimum, maximum and mean temperatures recorded at 3
PM during August 2015 for the weather station named " MUMBLES HEAD
(3609)‚Äù. Print the answer to the console. In addition, plot the location of
this weather station on a map using the MapGUI class supplied, and
include a screenshot of this in your Word document.

9) How many weather stations recorded a temperature of 25 degrees or
over? Print the number to the console. Plot the location(s) on a map using
the supplied MapGUI class and supply a screenshot in your Word
document.

10) What weather station had the most variation between minimum and
maximum temperature. Print out the ID, name,
latitude, longitude, and minimum and maximum temperatures to the
console. Plot the weather station on a map using the supplied MapGUI
class. Include a screenshot of the plot in your Word document.
